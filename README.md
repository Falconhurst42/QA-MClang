MCLang is programming language which can be converted to minecraft commands, using the MCLang compiler.

*Disclaimer: This project is not affiliated with Mojang or Minecraft in any way.*

## Installation

The MCLang compiler can be installed either by downloading it directly (recommended) or by building the project yourself.

### Direct download

The MCLang compiler can be downloaded directly by going to the [Releases](https://github.com/PurpleStripedUnicorn/MCLang/releases) page. The operating systems Windows and Linux are supported. The executable is downloaded directly and should be run in the command line.

### Building the project

You can also choose to build the project for yourself to make modifications or to use a later (unstable) version of MCLang. This can be done by downloading the source code here in GitHub, then in Linux run `make`* to build the MCLang compiler. The executable will be named `build/main`. You can also use `make os=WINDOWS`** (still in Linux) to build the project for Windows.

_* Compilation has only been tested on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS, g++ version 9.3.0._

_** Compilation has only been tested on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS, gcc version 9.3-win32._

## Usage

For a full explanation see the [Beginner's guide](/docs/mclang/beginnersguide.md).

First create an `.mcl` file with your code in it. It is recommended to place the compiler executable and the `.mcl` file in the same folder.

Your `.mcl` file can be compiled with following command format:
```
<executable-name> <input-filename> [<command-line-options>]
```
The datapack output will by default be put in a folder named `out_datapack` in the current working directory. This can be changed by using the `-o` option. The default namespace for the datapack is `dp`. This can be changed by using the `-n` option. For a full list of command line arguments, use `-h` or `--help`.

It is recommended to use the `-o` option to reference a location inside the datapacks folder in your Minecraft world, so you don't have to copy and paste the output folder every time you run the compiler.

**Warning: If there is already a datapack present in the output folder, this datapack will be overwritten. Be very careful when selecting an output folder and make regular backups!**

When the generated datapack is placed inside the datapacks folder, open the Minecraft world and you can use `dp:functionname` to run a function you defined in your `.mcl` file.

## Syntax

The syntax is very similar to that of C. Minecraft commands can be inserted by using `/` at the start of a line. An example program that says hello to a player named PurpleStriped 100 times is shown below:
```
void main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        if ("entity @a[name=PurpleStriped]") {
            /tellraw @a[name=PurpleStriped] {"text":"Hello PurpleStriped!"}
        } else {
            /tellraw @a {"text":"There is no PurpleStriped :("}
        }
    }
}
```
After compilation and putting the generated datapack in the correct folder, this function can be run in Minecraft with `/function dp:main`. Refer to the [Syntax documentation](/docs/mclang/syntax.md) and the [Beginner's guide](/docs/mclang/beginnersguide.md) for more information.
